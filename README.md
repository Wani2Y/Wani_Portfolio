# [Project 1: Google Data Analytic Capstone](https://github.com/Wani2Y/R_Data_Analytics/tree/main/Google_Data_Analytic_Capstone)
Description: This project uses historical bike ride data from 2013 to 2023, to examine the different riding behaviours between subscribers and customers of Cyclistics.
As the total data set is fairly large (> 30 million rows), the scatter plots, U-test, Kruskalâ€“Wallis test, and Wilcoxon signed-ranking test may take a long time to run. To speed up the computation, you may sample a subset of the total data for the statistic tests. I did not because I was super stubborn :P
